# EU Migration Terminology Glossary Project

This repository contains a curated sample from a multilingual, corpus-based glossary of migration-related terms. The work was developed as part of a linguistics and NLP-focused assignment at Sapienza University of Rome. The glossary entries are aligned with EU communication standards and sourced from tools such as Sketch Engine, EMN Glossary, IATE, and EUR-Lex.

## Project Objective
To create learner-friendly, COBUILD-style glosses for key migration terms based on real-world usage and multilingual alignment (EN–IT), supporting EU policy communication and digital accessibility.

## Repository Contents
- `Joshua_glossary_sample.csv` – A small selection of lemma entries from my personal contribution, with English-Italian pairs, glossary source, and standardized definitions.
- `EU_Migration_Terminology_Assignment_Guide_Selected_Pages.pdf` – Selected pages from the original guide outlining methodology and format expectations.

## Tools Used
- Sketch Engine (EUR-Lex corpus)
- EMN Migration Glossary
- IATE (EU terminology database)
